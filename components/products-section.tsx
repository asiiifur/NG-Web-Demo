Thought for 2s
I'll update the company name to "Richman" and remove the image change functionality. Let me first search for all references to update.


Found company references

Found image manager

Updated to Richman brand
I've successfully updated the website to rebrand from NGIBD to Richman and completely removed the image manager functionality. All company references, URLs, email addresses, and branding elements have been changed to Richman across all components, SEO metadata, and configuration files. The dynamic image changing system has been removed, reverting to static image paths for better performance and simplicity.

I need to read the files before editing them and remove the ImageManager imports. Let me fix these issues:

Removed ImageManager imports

I've successfully removed all ImageManager imports and usage from the website, and cleaned up the localStorage image loading logic from the hero section.

Built e-commerce platform
I've successfully transformed the Richman website into a modern multi-shop e-commerce platform with advanced design and functionality. The new website features a warm amber color palette, dynamic product showcase with categories like glass products and dry fruits, and a seamless phone-based ordering system through contact modals. The design includes hover animations, responsive layouts, and prominent display of the contact number +880-2-XXXXXXX for easy customer ordering.

I'll update the website with proper header navigation and refocus the content on glass and food business. Let me first read the current header and other components.

Read about section

Updated navigation and content
I've updated the website with proper header navigation focused on glass and food business, changed the company description to emphasize premium glass collections and gourmet food products, and created a comprehensive products section featuring "Premium Glass Vase Set" as a product category. The navigation now includes specific sections for Glass Collection and Food Products, while maintaining the Bangladesh context but repositioning Richman as a premium glass and food retailer rather than an industrial developer.

I've updated the products section to better align with the glass and food business focus, changing "Dry Fruits" category to "Food Products" and updating product descriptions to emphasize premium quality and craftsmanship. The categories now include "Premium Collections" and "Gift Sets" to reflect the upscale positioning, and the call-to-action buttons now display the phone number directly for easier customer contact.
